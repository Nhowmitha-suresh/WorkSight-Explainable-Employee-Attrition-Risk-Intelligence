## Day 1 (Completed)
- Repository initialized and cleaned
- GitHub remote configured
- Initial documentation and structure completed
## Day 2 (Continued)
- Verified dataset structure and target variable
- Identified class imbalance in attrition
- Categorized numerical and categorical features
- Observed early relationship between overtime and attrition
## Day 3
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed attrition distribution and class imbalance
- Identified key drivers: overtime, job satisfaction, income
- Derived business insights from visual patterns
## Day 4 (Continued)
- Interpreted feature correlation heatmap
- Identified strongly related and redundant features
- Shortlisted key drivers influencing attrition
## Day 5
- Cleaned dataset and removed irrelevant columns
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Scaled numerical features
- Prepared model-ready train and test datasets
## Day 6
- Trained baseline Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated model using confusion matrix and classification report
- Identified recall as a key metric for attrition prediction
## Day 7 – Model Improvement & Evaluation

- Trained an improved Random Forest model for employee attrition prediction
- Applied class balancing to handle imbalanced attrition data
- Generated predictions on the test dataset
- Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix and classification report
- Achieved high overall accuracy but identified low recall for attrition cases
- Analyzed false negatives as a critical risk in HR decision-making
- Compared Random Forest performance with baseline Logistic Regression
- Identified recall improvement as the next key objective
